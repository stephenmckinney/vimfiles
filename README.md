# my vimfiles

Configures Vim with a focus on Ruby and Rails development
and testing. Solarized **ALL** the things.

The goal is to use tmux + zsh + vim as a Ruby and Rails IDE on OS X. See
[dotfiles](https://github.com/stephenmckinney/dotfiles).

## Getting started

```shell
git clone git@github.com:stephenmckinney/vimfiles.git
cd ~/.vimfiles && rake install
```

Next, launch vim and watch it install all plugins.
